A Fun JavaScript time-based multiple choice questions quiz app.

It picks up questions randomly based on their lavel (easy, medium, hard) from the questions array.

## How

Questions are stored as an array of objects in main.js.
Every question object has one of the levels: easy, medium, hard.
For now there are two questions of each level.
Every time you refresh the page, it takes one (can be any number) random question from each level and show it.

### Timer

When time is finished. Quiz is submitted and you can no longer submit the quiz.
